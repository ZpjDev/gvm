# install.sh - install gvm, or check out this repository, without autotools.
#
# The old installation story was two half-working ones:
#
#   * `make install` copied the entire working tree, .git included, into
#     $prefix/gvm, so a local scratch file or an accidental `git status` diff
#     came along for the ride; and
#   * binscripts/gvm-installer cloned the repository into place and then
#     *overwrote* scripts/gvm with two generated lines, so the file a user
#     sourced was not the file the project ships.
#
# This installs an explicit list of files, keeps the repository in place when
# asked to, and never touches anything it did not create.

Usage: install.sh [options]

Installs gvm into a directory, and optionally adds one line to your shell
profile.

Options:
  --prefix <dir>    Where to install. Default: \$HOME/.gvm
  --profile <file>  Profile to update. Default: whichever of .bashrc, .bash_profile,
                    .profile and .zshrc exists, and .zshrc on macOS
  --no-profile      Do not touch any profile file
  --force           Install over an existing gvm, keeping installed Go versions
  --no-clone        Do not run 'git clone'; install from this directory as it is
  --keep-repo       Leave .git in place instead of renaming it to git.bak
  --uninstall       Remove an installed gvm, keeping \$GVM_ROOT/gos
  -h, --help        Show this message

Environment:
  GVM_NO_UPDATE_PROFILE=1   Same as --no-profile
  GVM_NO_GIT_BAK=1          Same as --keep-repo
